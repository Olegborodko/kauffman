          <p class="article__text-margin"><strong>Kansas City, MO.</strong> (October 24, 2016) – The Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and Kauffman Fellows announced a partnership today to spur more capital investment opportunities in the Midwest. Beginning in 2017, the Kauffman Foundation will award 12 scholarships that will enable emerging fund managers from Kansas City and across the Midwest to join Kauffman Fellows, a highly sought-after, two-year venture capital and leadership program based in Silicon Valley. “We are proud to partner with the Kauffman Foundation on this bold initiative to accelerate the education of investment and innovation leaders in Kansas City and across the Midwest,” said Jeff Harbach, CEO of Kauffman Fellows. “This is a big deal for investors in the region, and we welcome their participation in the Kauffman Fellows Program.”</p>
          <p class="article__text-margin">The $960,000 award will fund four scholarships per year for each of the next three years. Two recipients a year will hail from the Kansas City metropolitan area; one from the heartland states of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, and Nebraska; and one from the midcontinent region stretching from the Rocky Mountains to the Appalachians. The goal of the scholarships is to enhance capital-formation expertise across the Midwestern United States and support Kansas City as a regional hub for investor networks.</p>
          <p class="article__text-margin">“This partnership is a key component of our emerging ‘Kauffman Midwest Capital Creation’ initiative, designed to address key market gaps and help Midwestern entrepreneurs become more successful,” said Wendy Guillies, President and CEO of the Kauffman Foundation. “Our research released today shows signs that new sources of capital are emerging outside of traditional geographic hubs. Our work with Kauffman Fellows provides access to an extensive network of thought leaders who will be invaluable resources as we work to solve the Midwest capital gap.”</p>
